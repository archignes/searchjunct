# SearchJunct

## Overview
SearchJunct is a single-page application designed to facilitate multi-engine search selection and routing. This tool serves as a speculative design prototype, providing a platform for exploration and cogitation, particularly around user interaction with multiple search engines and finding the best tool for the job.

## Features
- **Multi-Engine Search Selection:** Enables queries through multiple search engines based on user selection.
- **Client-Side Operation:** All functionalities, including search logging (if opted by the user), operate on the client side to support user privacy.
- **(Under Construction) Manual and Automatic Routing:** Users can manually select desired search engines or rely on automatic routing based on weighted preferences.
- **(Under Construction) Search Logging (Optional):** Optional feature allowing users to store their search history locally, within their browser.
- **Default Search Engine Setup:** Supports users to set SearchJunct as their default search engine.
